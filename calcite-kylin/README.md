# Abount KyCalcite

KyCalcite is a customized calcite for better kylin use. 

Naming convension of different branch is kylin-{CALCITE_VERSION}.x, e.g. kylin-1.13.0.x

Naming convension of different releases (the name could be used for creating git tag, or pom version name), is {CALCITE_VERSION}-kylin-r{RELEASE_NUMBER}, e.g. 1.13.0-kylin-r1

For new KyCalcite releases we need to deploy it to our own Nexus server (kynexus.chinaeast.cloudapp.chinacloudapi.cn:8081), if you don't have enough permission please contact hongbin.ma@kyligence.io

**Since sonar does not allow overriding formal releases, you might choose to use a snapshot version name, e.g. 1.13.0-kylin-r1-SNAPSHOT**

steps:

1. publish the new kycalcite to nexus server
2. change kap and kylin's calcite pom dependency version
3. create a tag for the commit on which the new kycalcite is built from. Don't forget to push tags to server
